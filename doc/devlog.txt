chanM -- 2019-10-17 21:32
Set up GitHub repository and created DEVLOG

chanM -- 2019-10-17 21:52
Worked on design document: component map, database layout diagram, and role assignment

chanM -- 2019-10-18 9:21
Collaborated on design document: site map, deadlines

chanM -- 2019-10-21 24:14
Uploaded first finished version of design document

chanM -- 2019-10-22 01:28
Revised design document:
 - clarified roles
 - specified details of individual files and routes
 - streamlined database design
 - updated diagrams to match database changes

SQLite Operations: (clauses of the SELECT statement)
    JOIN       - associates column data between tables in certain ways
               - would be useful to correlate Usernames or Titles in different ways

    INNER-JOIN - combines columns from correlated tables
               - can be used to combine common Username/Author columns to see what contributions have been made

    LEFT-JOIN  - includes all rows of one table and rows of another (if they exist, NULL if not)
               - could use it for seeing contributions again in case users haven't made any contributions

    CROSS-JOIN - combines every row from two tables (like matrix multiplication?)
               - no current forseen use with our current design

From reading "Programming Sucks":
 - Review each others' code and make sure no mistakes snowball into bigger ones
 - Ask questions when in need of help
 - COMMENTS
 - Make reasonable deadlines so people can write 'good code' without shortcuts

Edited design.pdf to reflect improved database structure. Also fixed the site map

chanM -- 2019-10-22 11:16
Created simple starting app.py
Added /test route to test HTML frontend

friedH -- 2019-10-23 21:26
added initialfile.py as a temporary location to store SQL function headers
Some progress made on SQLite stuff in general

friedH -- 2019-10-23 21:26
pushed progress with initialfile.py which adds functionality to about half of the functions within the file

sontagC -- 2019-10-24 9:28
Began writing routes in app.py, specifically login and associated authentication 

wuJ -- 2019-10-24 9:34
Began on base.html, login.html and welcome.html. 
Able to login but not direct to another page yet 

friedH -- 2019-10-24 9:35
moved initialfil.py to utl and renamed to db.py
added more functions to db.py, majority of work done

chanM -- 2019-10-24 10:16
Changed secret key to randomly generated string
Temporarily disabled specific flashing error messages
Removed temporary /test route

chanM -- 2019-10-24 16:29
Made form to route to new /login/auth route
Changed route methods to POST
Added flashing into login.html
BUGS:
 - need to fix database interacting library to pass the cursor from app.py
 - need to add test user to be able to test /login in database
 
friedH -- 2019-10-24 22:06
finished all necessary functions in db library,
need to have them properly tested and checked.
Likely to occur tomorrow.

wuJ -- 2019-10-24 23:17
added html files for register and and home page.
need to test it with the backend code tomorrow.

Fixed commmenting consistencies in db.py library
Revamped db.py functions to take a cursor as first parameter
Added test account in user table in order to test login functionality:
 - Username: "test"
 - Password: "123"
Got logging in functionality working using test account
Removed unecessary code comments in db.py
