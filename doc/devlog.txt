SQLite Operations: (clauses of the SELECT statement)
    JOIN       - associates column data between tables in certain ways
               - would be useful to correlate Usernames or Titles in different ways

    INNER-JOIN - combines columns from correlated tables
               - can be used to combine common Username/Author columns to see what contributions have been made

    LEFT-JOIN  - includes all rows of one table and rows of another (if they exist, NULL if not)
               - could use it for seeing contributions again in case users haven't made any contributions

    CROSS-JOIN - combines every row from two tables (like matrix multiplication?)
               - no current forseen use with our current design
