## How To Run This Project
1. Install Flask, a Python module, using either of these methods:
    1. In a Terminal, run the following command:
        
            pip3 install flask
    2. Use a Python 3 virtual environment to bypass `pip3` restrictions on certain machines (i.e. School Computers).  Run the following commands subsequently:
    
            python3 -m venv <name of vitrual environment>   # creates a virtual environment named <name of vitrual environment>
            . <name of vitrual environment>/bin/activate    # activates the virtual environment
            pip3 install flask                              # installs flask Python mode
            deactivate                                      # deactivated the virtual environment
        - _Note: you must have the virtual environment activated to complete Step #_
2. Clone the project repository
